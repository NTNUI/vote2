### First you need to create a database  
With docker it's easy by running this command:
`npm run db`  
To stop the database type: `npm run stop-db`  

You can modify the given [env](.env)-file if you want, but it should already contain a working setup.

---
When the database is running you start the server by typing: `npm run dev`
